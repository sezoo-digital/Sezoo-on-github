# Sezoo-on-github
Testing creating web pages from GitHub repository 

There is, as of this release, absolutely no content of any use in this repository and presented on this site. I am just exploring the basic features available. Hope you weren't expecting more...

Basically I'm exploring how to use markdown to create formatted documents.

This is a table in markdown
| column 1 heading | column 2 Heading | column 3 heading |
| :---- | :---: | ----: |
| left alignment | centre alignment | right alignment |
| in markdown I've created columns of different character widths | simple column text | but the table should render neatly |
| this table has very | simple formatting | but it looks like the rows get an alternate shading effect |
| At least that's  | what | the rendered view looks like on GitHub |


# Heading 1
This would be text after the first level 1 heading

This is code block:
```
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
And this code block declares the language being used (which enables the rendering software to highlight terms appropriately)
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```

## Heading 2
This would be text after a level 2 heading
### Heading 3
This would be text after a level 3 heading
