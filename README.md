Testing creating web pages from GitHub repository 

There is, as of this release, absolutely no content of any use in this repository and presented on this site. I am just exploring the basic features available. Hope you weren't expecting more...

# Heading 1
This would be text after the first level 1 heading
## Heading 2
This would be text after a level 2 heading
### Heading 3
This would be text after a level 3 heading

How do I introduce a diagram into the markdown?
